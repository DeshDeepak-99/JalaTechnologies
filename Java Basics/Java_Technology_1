Class:
A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
To create a class, use the keyword "class".

eg:
 class Jala
 {
	Stetements;
	..
	..
	..
 }


Object:
In Java, an object is created from a class.To create an object of MyClass, specify the class name, followed by the object name, and use the keyword new.
Although there are other way also to create a Object but I generally use new keyword to create a class.

Eg:
public class Jala {
  int x = 5;

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Jala myObj = new Jala();
    System.out.println(myObj.x);
  }
}
 


Method:
A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
You can pass data, known as parameters, into a method.
Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions.

Eg:
public class Main {
  static void myMethod() {
    // statements;
	..
	..

  }
}
